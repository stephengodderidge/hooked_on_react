# Hooked on React

🔥Used at the `Reactadelphia Meetup` on April 16, 2019 🔥

The app has both a `Cart Summary` Page, and a `Hero Builder` page where you can add equipment to a hero to increase its level. The overall goal was to highlight the reuseability of hooks in a variety of situations. Checkout the `hooks` folder for the custom hooks that were used. 


## Getting Started

1. Clone repo
2. `cd` into the directory
3. Install `yarn` (and [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if not already installed) inside the react-accelerator repositiory: `brew install yarn`
4. Run `yarn`
5. Run `yarn next`

Dev Server URL: [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)

**NOTE:** The `Master` branch is all in Typescript. If you're unfamiliar with Typescript, no worries, checkout the `sans-typescript` branch after cloning the repo.

🎉 Happy Coding! 🎉
